I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that 
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

1.
The vector 
std::vector<Vehicle*> m_vehicles;
is storing address Vehicle class, so every time we store data of a vehicle we are 
allocating new memory for it:
result = new Car(sstr);
result = new Van(sstr);
result = new Racecar(sstr);
result = new Luxuryvan(sstr);
thus we need to delocate memory to prevent memory leak

2.
the loadData function first check if the file is opened currectly, then it will use 
try and catch error method to get error messages if the reading process is threw.
The only other solution I can think of is to manually check the file line by line if it 
contains any invalid information then put it into constructor of classes, but this way 
would cost more time so it's not a good solution.

3.
It is possible to use those, but if we use std::list<sdds::Vehicle> and std::vector<sdds::Vehicle>, 
but every time we pulling element from or push element into the list/vector the compiler would have 
to copy the data of that object again, so it will consume more memory and time so it is not 
efficient to use std::list<sdds::Vehicle> and std::vector<sdds::Vehicle>.
