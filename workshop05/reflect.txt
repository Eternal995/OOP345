I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that 
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

1.
functor is a function object, it can be called as a function but exist as a 
class/struct, it is implemented by overloading operator() in the class/struct.
we use functors when we want to use an object like a function.

lambda expression is a nameless function that stored in a variable, and can be 
called when we need, for example:
    auto fixPrice = [&](Book& book) {
        if (book.country() == "US")
            book.price() *= usdToCadRate;
        else if (book.country() == "UK" && book.year() >= 1990 && book.year() <= 1999)
            book.price() *= gbpToCadRate;
    };
we use lambda expressions when we only need that function a few times and/or we don't want 
to give it a name.


2.
we can just print out a message with error, instead of throw in the constructor. but with 
printing error we are not able to use try and catch method to handle the error.

3.
the Book and Movie class shares a lot similarity, so I would created a base class called Media 
or something then implementing Book and Movie as derived class, so we can implement the shared 
attribute/method in the base class and only need have their unique properties in the derived class.

4.
the default constructor is necessary, in the w5_p2.cpp, we are initializing using default constructor:

Movie movies[5];

so without default constructor, the program would not build successfully.
