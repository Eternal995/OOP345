This is a really fun project to do, I learned a lot about 
algorithm and data structure from this project. For example, 
the Workstation model is acting like a linked list, which we 
have pointer in the class member to point to next Workstation, 
also we are using the deque model, which can be used as both a 
stack and a queue. I also used a lot of the STL library functions
which can save a lot time.

Overall, this project is really useful for learning and reviewing 
everything I have learned from this course, and I believe it will be 
a really good experience for everything I will do for the future.
